<h1 id="unified-mathematical-finance">Unified Mathematical Finance</h1>
<p>Mathematical Finance provides a rigourous model for quanifying the
problems of how to move cash flows through time, how much does it cost,
and how risky is that. The classical Black-Scholes/Merton approach
assumes optimal hedging strategies executed in “continuous” time. A
complete model should allow for the non-optimal strategies that exist in
the real world and the fact that continuous time hedging is not
possible.</p>
<p>The atoms of finance are <em>holdings</em>, an amount of some
instrument and who owns it. Holdings interact via <em>transactions</em>,
a swap of holdings between a buyer and a seller on some date.</p>
<h2 id="datetime">Date/Time</h2>
<p>A <em>date</em>, or <em>datetime</em>, is an absolute time. Universal
Coordinated Time, or UTC, can be used for this. The permuted acronym has
an interesting history, as do all matters involved with measuring dates
and times.</p>
<p>The difference of two dates is a <em>time period</em> between two
dates. An <em>epoch</em> date can be used to convert between dates and
times. The epoch corresponds to time 0 and the date is a time period
offset from that. It is common to work with time in years, although
years is not a proper time period since it may involve leap days.
Likewise, using seconds has a similar problem because of leap
seconds.</p>
<h2 id="instrument"><a
href="https://ifrscommunity.com/knowledge-base/financial-instruments-definitions/">Instrument</a></h2>
<p>Instruments are contracts that provide ownership of a financial asset
to the holder and a financial liability of the instrument issuer.</p>
<p>The most fundamental instrument is cash in a particular currency.
Stocks provide equity in the issuing company. Bonds are a contractual
right to coupons and final principal repayment by the issuer. A
commodity is not an instrument, but a forward rate agreement to exchange
cash for the commodity at the termination date of the contract is. These
instruments are backed by tangible assets. Convertible bonds, asset
backed securities, and structured products are hybrid intruments.
Classical derivitive instruments are options, forwards, and futures.</p>
<p>A derivative contract specifies the cash flows between the buyer and
the seller. If a derivative is not traded in the market then there is a
mathematical theory originally developed by Black, Scholes, and Merton
to approximate its <em>value</em>. A sell-side trader can use that, plus
vigorish, to quote prices.</p>
<p>There is a credit component to every intrument. Either party might
default on their contractual obligations. This can be modeled using
<em>default time</em> and <em>recovery</em>.</p>
<h2 id="transaction">Transaction</h2>
<p>A <em>transaction</em> is a <em>buyer</em> and a <em>seller</em>
exchanging holding at a <em>transacton time</em>. The transaction <span
class="math inline">\chi = (t;a, i, o; a&#39;, i&#39;, o&#39;)</span>
indicates the <em>buyer</em> swapped the holding <span
class="math inline">(a, i, o)</span> for the holding <span
class="math inline">(a&#39;, i&#39;, o&#39;)</span> with the
<em>seller</em> at time <span class="math inline">t</span>. At
<em>settlement</em> <span class="math inline">u &gt; t</span> the buyer
holds <span class="math inline">(a&#39;,i&#39;,o)</span> and the seller
holds <span class="math inline">(a,i,o&#39;)</span>. The <em>price</em>
of the transaction is <span class="math inline">X = a/a&#39;</span> so
<span class="math inline">\chi = (t;Xa&#39;, i, o; a&#39;, i&#39;,
o&#39;)</span>. Prices are determined by the seller. The buyer decides
when to exchange holdings based on the seller’s price, among other
considerations.</p>
<p>Owning an instrument entails <em>cash flows</em>. Stocks pay
dividends or incur borrow costs when shorted. Bonds pay coupons.
Currencies do not have cash flows. Commodities may have storage costs.
Futures cash flows are the daily margin adjustents. The price of a
futures is always zero. Cash flows are added to holdings in proportion
to the amount of the instrument.</p>
<p>Given a set of holdings <span class="math inline">\{(a_j, i_j,
o_j)\}</span> define the <em>net amount</em> of asset <span
class="math inline">i</span> held by entity <span
class="math inline">o</span> to be <span class="math display">
    N(i, o) = \sum \{a_j\mid i_j = i, o_j = o\}.
</span> Transactions and cash flows change a set of holding over time.
If transaction <span class="math inline">\chi = (t;a, i, o; a&#39;,
i&#39;, o&#39;)</span> settles at <span class="math inline">u &gt;
t</span> then the set of holdings at <span class="math inline">u</span>
now includes <span class="math inline">\{(-a, i, o), (a&#39;, i&#39;,
o), (-a&#39;, i&#39;, o&#39;), (a, i, o&#39;)\}</span>. The holdings
with negative signs are often netted with existing buyer and seller
holdings. This assumes the holdings <span class="math inline">(a_0, i,
o)</span> and <span class="math inline">(a_1, i, o)</span> can be
combined to the holding <span class="math inline">(a_0 + a_1, i,
o)</span>. This is close to being true when <span
class="math inline">a_0 &gt; 0</span> and <span class="math inline">a_1
&gt; -a_0</span>, but that, and every, assumption should be made
explicit.</p>
<p>Cash flows are transactions between the buyer and the issuer that are
triggered by contractual obligations instead of trading events. If
issuer <span class="math inline">o&#39;</span> pays cash flow <span
class="math inline">C</span> in units of instrument <span
class="math inline">i</span> at time <span class="math inline">t</span>
then all holders of <span class="math inline">(a, i&#39;, o)</span>
incur a transaction <span class="math inline">(t;Ca, i, o; -Ca, i,
o&#39;)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>…</p>
<h2 id="discount">Discount</h2>
<p>The <em>discount</em> is the cost of moving 1 unit of some currency
in the future to time 0. The simplest case is a <em>zero coupon
bond</em> that pays 1 unit at time <span class="math inline">u</span>.
Let <span class="math inline">D(u)</span> be the price of buying
that.</p>
<p>A <em>fixed income instrument</em> is a portfolio of zero coupon
bonds paying cash flows <span class="math inline">c_i</span> at times
<span class="math inline">u_i</span>. If the price of the bond is <span
class="math inline">p</span> then <span class="math inline">p = \sum_i
c_i D(u_i)</span>.</p>
